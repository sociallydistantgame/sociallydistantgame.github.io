## About Socially Distant
<div class="container grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2">
<div class="md:p-4">
You play as a hacker. Your life path leads you into taking a gig that goes sour. As the world socially shuts down and moves to cyberspace in response to a global pandemic, you find yourself facing allegations of launching a major ransomware attack. It’s your goal to investigate who wrote the malware, put a stop to it before it further cripples society, and clear your name – all while fighting law enforcement, mis-information, and ever-increasing negative social reputation.
</div>
<div class="md:p-4">
Use an assortment of hacking tools and software to gain access to and explore a fully-fleshed-out world, all based on real life. Explore people’s social media, gain access to their private accounts, exploit vulnerabilities in their devices, and even break into the networks of large corporations, to track down a conspiracy and find the truth behind the ransomware attack. You are in complete control.
