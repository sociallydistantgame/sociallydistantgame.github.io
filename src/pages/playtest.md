## How this works
Socially Distant playtests are first-come first-serve based on operating system. Testing rounds will have a limited number of seats. There is no guarantee that you will be given access, but once you’re in, you’re in.

As a play-tester, you will be granted access to private sections on the Socially Distant Forum and acidic lighthouse Discord server to receive private development announcements and to share feedback.

You will also be given a temporary Steam key for the game, allowing you to add it directly to your library.

You will also be granted limited access to Nextcloud where you can see a roadmap of what’s being worked on in the game. If Discord isn’t your thing, you’ll also have access to a playtest chat on Nextcloud.

## How to apply
Applying to play-test the game is simple.

1. **Join the forum and Discord server** – you must have an acidic light community account to play-test Socially Distant, and you must at least be a forum member. Joining Discord is highly recommended, but optional.
2. **Have a Steam account** – builds of Socially Distant will only ever be distributed via Steam. Please note: if you receive a build of Socially Distant from anywhere other than Steam, you are being scammed.
3. **Fill out the application form** – you will need to provide basic contact info, tell us what platform you run, and complete a basic cyber-security aptitude test to verify your humanity and that you understand what this game’s about.

> **Notice**: If you intend to play on a Steam Deck or otherr handheld, you must have a physical keyboard. An external display and mouse is also recommended. Socially Distant isn’t intended to be played on a handheld gaming device.
